Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This code is made for the purpose of creating a diagnosis app, helping users differentiate between a cough and cold.
By monitoring their symptoms, the users will be able to select answers in a short questionnaire and figure out the
likelihood that they have a cough or cold.
 
Known Issues:
No known issues with code, but the buttons could also be customized and more questions
may be added to allow app to be more accurate.
